   % long AGO ,        the mice had a general council to consider what measUres    they could take to outwit their comMon enemy , the cat . some said this , and some said that but   at last a young mouse got up and said he had a proposal to make , which    @ he thought would meet the CaSe . you will all agree £££ , said ^°3 he , that our chief danger consists in the SLY and   treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches   us . now , if we could receive some   signal of her 198@ approach , we could easily    ESCAPE from her . i venture , therefore , to propose     &   that a small bell be procured , and attached BY a   [^?/& ribbon round the neck of the cat . by this means we should always know when she was about , and could easily 12895 retire while she was in the neighbourhood . ThiS    proposal Met with geNeraL    applause , until an old   Mouse got up and said  that is all very well , but who is 55609 to bell the cat ? the mice looked at one   another and nobody spoke . THEN the old mouse said it is easy to propose impossible       reMedies .
